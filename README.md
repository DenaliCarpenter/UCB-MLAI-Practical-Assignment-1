# Expensive Restaurant Coupon Acceptance Rates

This report analyzes the acceptance rates of coupons for expensive restaurants by exploring various factors such as destination, passenger type, weather, time of day, expiration time, gender, income, and age.

## Overall Acceptance Rate

The overall acceptance rate was about **44.6%**. This rate appears to be lower than the coupon acceptance rates seen for other venues, such as coffee shops and cheap restaurants.

## Destination

- **No Specific Destination:** Individuals who do not have a particular destination in mind and are not in a rush show a higher acceptance rate.
- **Heading to Work:** Those heading to work have the lowest acceptance rate, likely because they don’t have time to sit down and eat on the way.

## Passenger

- **Riding with Friends/Significant Others:** These individuals have a higher acceptance rate.
- **Riding Alone:** Individuals riding alone show the lowest acceptance rate, suggesting a reluctance to dine alone.
- **With Children:** Passengers with children in the car have a lower rate, perhaps due to the challenges of planning last-minute dining with kids.

## Weather and Temperature

- **Good Weather:** On sunny days without rain or snow, the acceptance rate is much higher.
- **Warmer Days:** The warmer the day, the higher the acceptance rate, supporting the idea that pleasant weather encourages coupon use.

## Time of Day

- **Peak Times:** The highest acceptance rates occur later in the morning and later in the afternoon.
- **Low Times:** Early in the morning and late at night show lower acceptance rates. This could suggest that people might be using the coupon to make up for a missed meal, such as breakfast or lunch.

## Expiration Time

- **1-Day Expiration:** Coupons that expire in 1 day have a much higher acceptance rate compared to those with shorter expiration periods. This extra flexibility may allow people to plan their dining more conveniently.

## Gender

- **Minimal Impact:** Gender does not appear to be a major factor in coupon acceptance. While the rate for women is slightly lower, this could be due to confounding variables (such as the presence of children).

## Income

- **Disposable Income:** Individuals with disposable income tend to accept the coupon more frequently.
- **Income Bracket of \\$25,000 - \\$37,499:** This group shows a higher acceptance rate compared to others, suggesting that those in this range might be more inclined to dine out due to limited time to cook.

## Age

### Group 5: Expiration Date Focused Group

- **Acceptance Rate:** 55.5%
